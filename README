My vim/gvim configuration
=========================

I've setup vim with my own .vimrc, hopefully nicely commented and well laid out.

I use [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to organise plugins. It's awesome; you should use it.
Hopefully something like it will become default in vim 8.
